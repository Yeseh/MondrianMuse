# Abstraction, Complexity, and the Art of Overengineering

Ever worked on a fancy system that looked perfect but fell apart when things changed? We've all been there. Sometimes, we create these big, complicated solutions that only make sense to the person who built them. I've done it too. Figuring out how much complexity is acceptable for a given problem can be tricky. So, how do we get it right?

In this session, we'll talk about how to solve programming problems in general. We'll look at how using abstract ideas can make projects complicated over time. Plus, we'll discuss two simple strategies to figure out the right level of complexity for your projects.

If you've ever felt stuck dealing with a super complicated system, this session is for you! Let's make things simpler and better together.
