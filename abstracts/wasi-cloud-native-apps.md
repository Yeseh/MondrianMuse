# Building Cloud Native Applications with WebAssembly

The WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) is revolutionizing the world of cloud computing as we know it. You might have heard that it has the potential to replace containers, but how does it work? How do you get started? And how do you build a real application with WASI?

In this talk, we will dive into what WebAssembly and WASI are and how to develop applications that use this new technology. Additionally, you will learn about several projects in the WASI ecosystem that can help accelerate your WASI development journey.

By the end of this talk, you will not only have a strong understanding of WASI and its capabilities, but also the knowledge and tools to begin solving real-world problems with this cutting-edge technology. If you are curious about WASI and what it can do for your applications, this is the talk for you!
